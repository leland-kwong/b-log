# Identity Folder

This folder contains **internal identity and positioning documents** used to guide my career direction, consulting positioning, and long-term professional strategy.

These files are:

- Private by intent
- Formative and evolving
- Not meant to be rendered on the website
- Not marketing copy
- Not public-facing documentation

Think of this folder as a **source of truth for how I understand my role**, so that everything else (site copy, posts, outreach, services) stays aligned.

## What Lives Here

Typical contents include:

- Career identity definitions
- Positioning notes
- Role boundaries and non-goals
- Service and engagement thinking
- Language experiments and phrasing
- Open questions to refine over time

These documents are written **for clarity, not polish**.

---

## What This Folder Is Not

This folder is intentionally **not**:

- A content directory
- A blog
- A public explanation of my work
- A replacement for the website or UX Patterns project

Anything that becomes public-facing should be _derived from_ these documents, not copied directly.

---

## How This Folder Is Used

- Updated iteratively as clarity improves
- Versioned to track how thinking evolves
- Referenced internally when making decisions
- Used to prevent identity drift over time

If something here feels “unfinished,” that is expected.

---

## Exposure Policy

Files in this folder:

- Should not be linked publicly
- Should not be auto-rendered by the site
- May be selectively summarized or adapted elsewhere

Clarity first. Visibility later.
