Design a minimal, high-contrast personal homepage for a senior frontend & design engineer.

Style & tone:
• White background, black text only
• No gradients, no cards, no background colors
• Strong contrast through typography, scale, and spacing
• Calm, confident, editorial feel (think Stripe internal docs / Linear marketing pages)
• Modern, professional, understated

Typography:
• Large, bold name at the top
• Clear hierarchy using font size and weight (not color)
• Generous whitespace
• Sans-serif font (Inter-style)

Content (single-page):
• Name at the top: “Leland Kwong”
• Short role statement:
“Frontend & Design Engineer focused on UX patterns for complex enterprise systems.”
• Section titled “Current work”
• A prominent text link to “Enterprise UX Patterns”
• Small one-line description underneath:
“Practical UX patterns for data-heavy enterprise applications.”
• Section titled “Contact”
• Email link: leland@lelandkwong.com

Layout:
• Single column
• Left-aligned
• No navigation bar
• No footer
• Content should feel centered vertically with plenty of breathing room

Goal:
The page should feel like a confident professional landing page that acts as a funnel to other work, not a blog or portfolio.
