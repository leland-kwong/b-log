# Essential tools and resources

This is a curated, ever-growing, always-updated list of tools I've built, developers I follow, and websites that I think you might find useful.

## Tools I live by

- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**

  Free and open source by Microsoft, this editor has taken the development world by storm. It is similar to its cousin [Atom](https://atom.io) which used to be my daily driver.

- [npm](https://npmjs.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - package managers

  A package manager is essential to every developers toolkit. Not only do these tools make it easier to deal with dependencies, they also happen to be a excellent way for discovering other libraries.

- **[Icomoon](https://icomoon.io)**

  Svg icons are the new standard, and this tool makes it a breeze to manage. Simply create your own icons or use Icomoon's free / paid icon sets.

## Developers and designers you might like to follow

- **[Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net)**

  Founder of [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com), one of the most popular websites about web development. Also co-founder of [Codepen](https://codepen.io), an excellent tool for both experimenting as well as showcasing your skills to the world.

- **[David Desandro](https://desandro.com)**

  Known for [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/) library and founder of [Metafizzy](https://metafizzy.co). He's a frontend developer, graphic designer, and all around really talented creative coder.

- **[Paul Irish](https://www.paulirish.com/)**

  A web performance guru at Google, this man almost needs no introduction. When it comes to frontend development and web performance, Paul Irish always dishes out some of the best information out there.

- **[Justin Windle](https://soulwire.co.uk)**

  Generative artist and a creative coder. His website has some drool-worthy creative coding experiments. His [Codepen](https://codepen.io/soulwire/) also has some really cool projects as well.

- **[Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/)**

  When it comes to data visualization, few people are as skilled as Mike. He's one of the original authors of [D3](https://d3js.org/), one of the most popular data vis libraries out there.

- **[Todd Motto](https://ultimatecourses.com/)**

  When it comes to Angular tutorials and knowledge, Todd is your goto guy. He runs workshops, does consulting, and has a website dedicated to Angular.

- **[Ana Tudor](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/)**

  Ana makes some of the most wild looking shapes and animations using pure CSS. She can make things like 3-d dodecahedrons turn into hexagons, and crazy SVG animations.

  Legendary generative artist and creative coder. He's been playing with the stuff since 1999 and he hasn't skipped a beat since. His work has been inducted into the [Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt Design Museum](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/) and National Design Triennial 2006 “Design Life Now”.
